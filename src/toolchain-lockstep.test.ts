/**
 * 🔴 A LOCAL SHELL AND CI THAT INSTALL DIFFERENT TOOLCHAINS MAKE A GREEN RUN
 * MEAN NOTHING.
 *
 * `flake.nix` is what a contributor's shell installs (`nix develop` / direnv);
 * `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is what the merge gate installs. When those two
 * disagree, "it passes locally" stops being evidence about the gate and the
 * gate stops being evidence about anyone's machine — and nothing announces the
 * split, because both sides stay green while testing different things.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical here. Before the flake landed, this workflow pinned
 * `node-version: 20` and installed with npm. Node 20 reached end-of-life on
 * 2026-04-30 and has been removed from nixpkgs — so at the moment the flake was
 * written there was no `nix develop` on any machine that could reproduce what
 * CI was running, and no file in the repo said which node the app was meant to
 * be built with. `.nvmrc` is now that file.
 *
 * The two pins are handled asymmetrically, on purpose:
 *
 *   node — ONE authority, `.nvmrc`. flake.nix reads it with `builtins.readFile`
 *          and CI reads it via `actions/setup-node`'s `node-version-file`.
 *          Neither restates a version, so neither can drift. What this file
 *          guards is that the arrangement is still WIRED THAT WAY: a future
 *          edit that hardcodes `node-version: 22` back into the workflow would
 *          reintroduce exactly the split described above, and nothing else
 *          would notice.
 *
 *   pnpm — TWO statements, because `pnpm/action-setup` reads only its own
 *          `version:` input or `package.json`'s `packageManager` field, and
 *          adding `packageManager` would change what the PLATFORM's builder
 *          does (`block.manifest.json`'s `buildCommand: pnpm run build` runs
 *          against that same file). So the major is written down twice and
 *          asserted equal here. This is the assertion that actually compares
 *          two values; the node ones assert a structure.
 *
 * These files are read off disk rather than imported because none of them is a
 * module: `.nvmrc`, `flake.nix` and a YAML workflow have no import form at all.
 * `import.meta.url` makes the paths independent of the runner's working
 * directory. (`src/manifest.test.ts` — the sibling guard that keeps the
 * manifest and package versions in lockstep — can and does import its two JSON
 * files directly, since `tsconfig.json` here sets `resolveJsonModule`.)
 *
 * Every extractor below THROWS when the shape it expects is missing, rather
 * than returning undefined. A guard that silently passes once someone deletes
 * the step it inspects is worse than no guard: it reads as coverage while
 * providing none.
